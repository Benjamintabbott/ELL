🧠 About This App ELL (English Language Learner) is a simple, interactive learning tool designed for young English language learners to build familiarity with everyday vocabulary through immersive environments.

🏠 How It Works The app opens with a selection of rooms (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, classroom).

Clicking a room opens it full screen, creating an immersive scene.

Key objects in the room are highlighted with a soft white glow.

When a user clicks an object, the spoken name of that item plays through the speakers.

🎯 Who It's For ELL is built especially for young children learning English as a second language. It helps them:

Connect spoken English to visual objects

Get comfortable with the sounds and rhythm of common vocabulary

Practice listening and identification in a non-intimidating, interactive setting

🧩 Why It Matters Many learners don’t have consistent access to native English environments. This app offers a simple way to bridge that gap at home or in the classroom, using visual reinforcement and auditory learning.
